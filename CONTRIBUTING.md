# Copyright Assignment

Thank you for your contribution. Here is some important legal stuff.

By submitting a pull request for this project, unless explicitly stated otherwise, you agree to assign your copyright of the contribution to **The RedPRL Development Team** when it is accepted (merged with or without minor changes). You assert that you have full power to assign the copyright, and all copyrights owned by third parties are explicitly marked with appropriate copyright notices. If you are employed, please check with your employer about the owernership of your contribution.

This would allow us to, for example, re-license the entire codebase under Apache 2.0 or transfer the ownership of the project to someone else *without your further consent*. We demand this assignment so that we do not have to ask *everyone* who has ever contributed for these activities. This requires trust, and if you feel uncomfortable about this assignment, please make an explicit note.
